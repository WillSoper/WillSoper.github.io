title: Adventures with a raspberry pi
---

I've had a lot of fun with my raspberry pi, and I decided that it would be helpful to write up how I completed each of my projects. 

This is a list of all the projects that I've done so far, I'll add to them as and when I complete any more!

- [Getting started]({% post_url 2015-05-13-getting-started-with-raspberry-pi %}): installing Raspbian, getting connected and doing one off configurations.
