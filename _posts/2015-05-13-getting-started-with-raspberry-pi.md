title: Getting started with Raspberry Pi
---
This is part of a series of posts detailing my adventures with a raspberry pi. [You can find the whole series here.]({% post_url 2015-05-13-adventures-with-raspberry-pi %})
##What you'll need:

- Raspberry Pi (I'm using the version 2)
- 8GB MicroSD card (or bigger)
- USB MicroSD reader (for writing Raspbian to the SD card)
- Micro USB charger (for powering the Raspberry Pi)

You *might* need the following, it depends how adventurous you're feeling (it would probably be easier /with/ these):

- HDMI cable (and a monitor or TV to plug it in to)
- USB keyboard and mouse
