This is part of a series of posts detailing my adventures with a raspberry pi. [You can find the whole series here.]({% post_url adventures-with-a-raspberry-pi %})

This is quite a short post, but hopefully a helpful one!

I spend most of my time working with my Raspberry Pi on SSH remotely, rather than actually using a Window Manager, but every now and again I have the need to use LXDE (which is the window manager that Raspbian comes with).

Until today, one thing had **always** frustrated me in LXDE, and that was how **unbelievably hard** it is to resize a window when the area that you need to grab with your mouse is only one pixel wide. There are many different ways to fix this, but today I learnt something new which I felt was worthy of it's own (short) post.

>Alt+R-Click (then drag) will resize the window

>Alt+L-Click (then drag) will move a window

You can do this anywhere on the window, without the need to find the tiny one pixel border around the window!
